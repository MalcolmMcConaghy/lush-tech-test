# lush-tech-test

NextJS starter with shadcn and tailwindCSS for UI components

If I were to extend this project with more time, I would:

- Write more tests
- Write a test file for the Product page. Difficulty here is figuring out server side apollo mocking.
- Have pagination save page when going between Product and Product List page
- Add the Add to cart functionality and Drawer to display cart
- Amalgamate the variants into one listing with a choice of variant

## Run application

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
